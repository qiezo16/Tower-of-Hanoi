# Tower-of-Hanoi
My attempt at making a tower of Hanoi game ( made after learning how to complete LinkedList, DoublyLinkedList, Nodes and Stacks

I made this after learning the above in a week with some direction. I got stuck multiple times espcially in the get_input function where the options would infinetely repeat and never actually save moves,
Still got to work on some syntax practice because i mainly think too fast and forget to run functions as an action and getting the return value rather than just calling back functions without the parenthesis.
